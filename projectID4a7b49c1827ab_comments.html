<HTML><BODY>This is an easy to read overview of Sanskrit Literature, by the well-known Sanskritist Arthur A. MacDonell (author of a well-known grammar of Sanskrit). This work gives an overview of the very long history of Sanskrit literature, starting with the ancient Rigveda, up to the time of the Mohammedan rule, spanning thousands of years.

<p>The usual Sanskrit accents (macrons and underdots) appear, but I have not seen Devanagari script. In a few places, additional accents (underbar) and double accents (macron plus acute) are used. This work again uses ç/Ç for the sh-sound that is currently often represented by &#347;/&#346;, but we keep it as it is in the original.

<p>(Added 11 Aug 2009) For those who find the typing of macrons cumbersome, you can also use the circumflex, i.e., where you see &#257;, you can type â. When you see a real circumflex, please make a small note after the word (e.g., hôtel[**ô in orig]) Don't forget about the underdotted letters, though, which remain to be typed with codes, e.g., &#7789; is to be typed [t.].

<p>(Added 11 Aug 2009) In discussion of metres, you will see lying dashes and bows, and sometimes a bow with a dash below it. Please proofread these as [long], [short], [shortlong], respectively.

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
